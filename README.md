Description:
This is NOT an example of a responsive website design.
This is a website design from a vanilla javascript learning course the point of the project was to review topics and best practices of advanced DOM Manipulation.
Again the main focus is to utilize standard css3 and vanilla javascript to implement such things as slider components, tabbed components and modern website behavior.
Most of my work experience is with frameworks, so this project was to learn the nuts and bolts of doing it without frameworks such as bootstrap & Jquery.
